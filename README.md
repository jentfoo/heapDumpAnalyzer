# heapDumpAnalyzer
High performance analyzer for java heap dump files.  Right now it is a simple parser, with minimal resulting information.  In the future it will do more complex computation and analysis on the heap file.

#Current status:

Still very much a WIP.  This is a foundation of work that can be expanded on to reach our end goals.  But currently results are not verified to be accurate (or at least don't match other programs), and usage is clunky at best.

Even though this is probably not useful yet, and is still a work in progress, it is not abandoned.  Given the time, need, or help, this project will continue to make progress towards being the fastest way to analyze heap dumps available.
